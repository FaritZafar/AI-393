KNN:
The KNN is k-nearest neighbors’ algorithm it is a most unique and simple algo it is also used in machine learning so we can used for both the problems known as classification and regression. The most unique part it is easy to implement and easy to get. But it has a issue it is slow and the size of the data use to grows.

Example:
The most common and unique example of KNN is voting system. We can convert it into sub classes and functions like “Vote” and “Not vote”.

SVM:
It is known as support vector machines it is the most solid reliable and observable machine learning algorithm which is used for both function classification and regression. But for most of the time it is used for the classification problems. It got some unique and professional way of in hence implementation as revision to other machine learning algorithm.


Example:
SVM related example is drawing a straight line in between two unique classes. Each and every data you write will go on the one side which is label as one class the rest points went on the other side known as secondary class.

MultinomialNB:
The MultinomialNB Naïve Bayes Classifer is a machine learning model basically used for large amount of data and good for the use of classification with some new techniques of discrete features. If we take MultinomialNB distribution it normally requires numeric count.
